# SQL-Revision
### **ðŸš€ Day 1 of my 15-day SQL revision journey with MySQL! ðŸŽ‰ Even with my experience in SQL, I'm excited to revisit the basics and showcase my skills to potential recruiters. Today, I set up my environment, created a database, tables, and inserted some initial data. This is just the beginning. Stay tuned for more SQL practice and insights over the next 15 days!** ###

### The CREATE statement in SQL is used to create a new database or table. It's a fundamental command that establishes the structure for storing data.
### The INSERT statement in SQL is used to add new rows of data to a table. It allows you to populate the table with information.
